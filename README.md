# CPhysics

CPhysics is a 2D physics engine written in C++ with the intention of being used in games. It it built with no third-party-library dependencies other than various standard c header files such as cmath.

The testbuild involves Dear imgui, cereal, glfw and glad for testing purposes. For now, its only been created in Visual Studio but will create cmake at a later stage to make it compiler independent.

## Credits
Dirk Gregorius and Erin Catto's online resources have proven instrumental in learning how to approach and construct a physics engine. Their gdc talks, documentation and numerous physics engine forum posts have been of great use and would highly recommend looking them up for anyone interested in learning about physics engines.
